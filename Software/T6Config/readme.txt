Running T6Config
1) Install T6config by clicking on T6Config.exe 
2) Click through the prompts
3) Plug in your cable to TX and turn on Tx.
4) Plug USB cable into PC (you should have already completed the driver install)
5) Select your com port (a new com port would have been added during the driver install)
6) Make sure it's communicating by moving sticks around and viewing the green/blackbars moving
7) CLICK GETUSER BEFORE you make any changes. Failing to do so may wipe out your stored information in the Tx.


T6config does NOT like com ports higher than com 9. 
If your USB driver selects com9, then find the USB device in hardware manager 
and go to the properties section and change the com port.

Save your settings to a default file so you can come back to it.
